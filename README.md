# Diabetes Prediction (View my [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/maxboonjindasup/diabetes-prediction) notebook)

## Introduction
Diabetes, with its potential for severe health complications, represents a significant challenge for individuals and a substantial economic burden on healthcare systems. Early identification not only improves health outcomes but also presents a strategic business opportunity. Proactive management reduces healthcare costs and fosters a healthier patient population. This dual impact of improving health outcomes and optimizing healthcare economics underscores the compelling business case for leveraging machine learning in diabetes identification and management.
