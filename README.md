## Introduction
Diabetes, with its potential for severe health complications, represents a significant challenge for individuals and a substantial economic burden on healthcare systems. Early identification not only improves health outcomes but also presents a strategic business opportunity. Proactive management reduces healthcare costs and fosters a healthier patient population. This dual impact of improving health outcomes and optimizing healthcare economics underscores the compelling business case for leveraging machine learning in diabetes identification and management.

Here I present 2 models trained off of 100,000 entries encompassing the following medical and demographic details:

| #   | Feature              |
| --- | -------------------- |
| 1   | gender               |
| 2   | age                  |
| 3   | hypertension         |
| 4   | heart_disease        |
| 5   | smoking_history      |
| 6   | body mass index (BMI)|
| 7   | HbA1c_level          |
| 8   | blood_glucose_level  |
| 9   | diabetes             |
